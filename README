Compile kotlin/jvm:
- In the terminal, type: gradlew <package>
- <package> is:
-- packageMsi for Windows
-- packageDmg for macOS
-- packageDeb for Debian systems
- see the output for where the installer is placed

Compile kotlin/native:
- In the terminal, type: kotlinc-native <path-to-main.kt> -o <name-of-exe>
- Example: kotlinc-native mingwX64App/src/mingwX64Main/kotlin/main.kt -o myApp
- the myApp.exe will appear in the directory where the command was typed
- multiple files must be added to the command is they are used in the project
- TODO: learn to do this with gradle

kotlin/native library:
- Creates a kotlin library (.klib) for use in kotlin/native projects
- In the terminal, type: kotlinc-native <path-to-main.kt> -p library -o <name-of-exe>
- Example: kotlinc-native mingwX64App/src/mingwX64Main/kotlin/main.kt -p library -o myApp
- the myApp.klib will appear in the directory where the command was typed
- multiple files must be added to the command is they are used in the project
- to use it, type: "klib install myLib.klib"
-- to use the klib while compiling, use the "-l myLib" flag
-- Example: kotlinc-native mingwX64App/src/mingwX64Main/kotlin/main.kt -l myLib -o myApp
- TODO: learn to do this with gradle
